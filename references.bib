  abstract = "The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a widely used resource that
              comprehensively organizes and defines the phenotypic features of
              human disease, enabling computational inference and supporting
              genomic and phenotypic analyses through semantic similarity and
              machine learning algorithms. The HPO has widespread applications
              in clinical diagnostics and translational research, including
              genomic diagnostics, gene-disease discovery, and cohort
              analytics. In recent years, groups around the world have
              developed translations of the HPO from English to other
              languages, and the HPO browser has been internationalized,
              allowing users to view HPO term labels and in many cases synonyms
              and definitions in ten languages in addition to English. Since
              our last report, a total of 2239 new HPO terms and 49235 new HPO
              annotations were developed, many in collaboration with external
              groups in the fields of psychiatry, arthrogryposis, immunology
              and cardiology. The Medical Action Ontology (MAxO) is a new
              effort to model treatments and other measures taken for clinical
              management. Finally, the HPO consortium is contributing to
              efforts to integrate the HPO and the GA4GH Phenopacket Schema
              into electronic health records (EHRs) with the goal of more
              standardized and computable integration of rare disease data in
              EHRs.",

  title    = "Systematic Classification of Disease Severity for Evaluation of
              Expanded Carrier Screening Panels",
  author   = "Lazarin, Gabriel A and Hawthorne, Felicia and Collins, Nicholas S
              and Platt, Elizabeth A and Evans, Eric A and Haque, Imran S",
  abstract = "Professional guidelines dictate that disease severity is a key
              criterion for carrier screening. Expanded carrier screening,
              which tests for hundreds to thousands of mutations
              simultaneously, requires an objective, systematic means of
              describing a given disease's severity to build screening panels.
              We hypothesized that diseases with characteristics deemed to be
              of highest impact would likewise be rated as most severe, and
              diseases with characteristics of lower impact would be rated as
              less severe. We describe a pilot test of this hypothesis in which
              we surveyed 192 health care professionals to determine the impact
              of specific disease phenotypic characteristics on perceived
              severity, and asked the same group to rate the severity of
              selected inherited diseases. The results support the hypothesis:
              we identified four ``Tiers'' of disease characteristics (1-4).
              Based on these responses, we developed an algorithm that, based
              on the combination of characteristics normally seen in an
              affected individual, classifies the disease as Profound, Severe,
              Moderate, or Mild. This algorithm allows simple classification of
              disease severity that is replicable and not labor intensive.",
